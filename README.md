Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am **Ruihua Han**. 

- My current research focuses on the **optimal control and motion planning** for ground mobile robots navigating unknown, cluttered, and inhabited environments. I am particularly interested in integrating **learning techniques with optimization theory** and applying them to real robots to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of intelligent autonomous systems.

- I am deeply passionate about developing the generally intelligent and theoretically guaranteed robotics systems capable of performing complex tasks comparable to human capabilities. 

<!-- I am looking for the **postdoctoral  opportunity** in the robotics field.  -->
