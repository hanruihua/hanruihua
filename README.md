Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am **Ruihua Han**. 

- I am deeply passionate about developing the generally intelligent and theoretically guaranteed robotics systems capable of performing complex tasks comparable to human capabilities. 

- My current research focuses on the optimal control and motion planning for ground mobile robots navigating cluttered and inhabited environments.
 
- I am utilizing learning techniques and optimization theory (Model-based learning) to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of mobile robot systems. Additionally, I am also interested in the whole body humanoid robot control and planning.

I am looking for the **postdoctoral  opportunity** in the robotics field.
